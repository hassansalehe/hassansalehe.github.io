Technical writing is a challenging task. It is even tougher if you are from technical fields like me and don't have writing experience. While writing with your computer, you may run out of ideas or may lose the mood to write altogether. And thus you are stuck. Here I have compiled five things you can use to keep going. I have used them and they have proved quite effective. I hope that you will find them useful.

#### 1. A walk

Get out of your desk and leave your computer for a short walk. Your walking pace should neither be too long nor too short. You can walk along the corridor, around the garden, or anywhere but prefer quieter places. Think about your problem while walking. This helps you quickly find ideas to write. Go back to writing once you gather your ideas.

#### 2. A pencil, and a writing pad

Close your computer and take an empty paper and write your ideas on. You have more freedom while writing with a pen than with a keyboard. This is because the flow of ideas on a piece of paper is smoother than while typing. Transfer your notes into your writing draft once you are done scratching the paper. This whole process stimulates your thinking.

#### 3. A quiet and beautiful garden

Go to a nice garden. Sit there alone and think about what to write. Your brain will have a room for digesting the problem and organizing points while refreshing from the nice smell of flowers. In most cases, I take with me a writing pad, a pen, and an empty paper or the printout of the writing draft. Then I write my ideas as they come through.

#### 4. Self-talk

Find a quiet place and try to ask questions to yourself and try to answer them loudly but not too loud. The questions should be specific to what you want to write. For example, if you are summarizing a related work, loudly ask yourself questions like "What is this work about and what are the main contributions?" Then answer each question aloud. Use a freestyle way of talking; speak as ideas come through in your mind. You will find out that some of the things you talked had points which could definitely go to your writing draft. Gather them and revisit your writing.

#### 5. An Audio recorder

This is similar to self-talk. Take an audio recorder and try to explain the things you are supposed to write about. You can talk randomly, but try to focus on the topic that you were trying to write about. Once you finish recording, save your audio and listen to it. You may find out that most part of your talk is garbage, but you will automatically find points buried in the garbage that should go to the writing draft.

To end, I have provided five things which have been helpful when I'm stuck while writing. It is my anticipation they will help you too. Moreover, I would like to hear from you about different things that you have used.
