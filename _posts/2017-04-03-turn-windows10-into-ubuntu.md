#### Introduction
In the past, there were two options you could access Ubuntu in 
your machine which runs Windows OS as as a default operating system:
1. Creating a dual boot with Ubuntu
2. Using Virtualization

Nowadays, if you have Windows 10, you can benefit from the Beta 
Ubuntu feature that ships with Win10. I will show the steps on 
how to get it to working full.

#### The Steps
1. [Jack explains how to turn on the Ubuntu beta feature on 
Windows 10.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide). 
Once you turn the Ubuntu feature, go to step 2.
2. [Install ConEmu, a better, multi-feature terminal emulator](https://conemu.github.io/)
3. Install developement tools
  * I have compiled a small list of tools you can install on your Ubuntu account to 
    make a full development environment.
    ```bash
  
    ```
  4. [Add bash/terminal to select from right-click context.](http://www.windowscentral.com/how-launch-bash-shell-right-click-context-menu-windows-10)
