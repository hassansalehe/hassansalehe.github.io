### Bio

![myPhoto](/myPhoto.jpg){:width="250px"}

I'm Hassan Salehe Matar and I'm a recent Ph.D graduate of Computer Sciences and  
Engineering from Koc University in Istanbul. During my PhD studies, I had been  
lucky to be advised by [Assist. Prof. Didem Unat](http://home.ku.edu.tr/~dunat/).
My research focuses on designing  
and improving algorithms and tools for detecting concurrency errors in parallel programs.

I previously worked on improving performance of race detection algorithms  
using IntelÂ® TSX, and I was later interned at Intel in Munich for 1.5 years.

My projects are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/hassansalehe) but you can
read more about them [here](projects).

You can access my publications [here](publications).

My resume can be accessed [using this link](resume).
