![myPhoto](/myPhoto.jpg)

I'm Hassan Salehe Matar and I'm a software design engineer at ASML.

I previously worked on improving performance of race detection algorithms  
using IntelÂ® TSX, and I was later interned at Intel in Munich for 1.5 years.

Besides, I have a Ph.D of Computer Sciences and Engineering from  
Koc University in Istanbul. During my PhD studies, I had a privilege  
to be advised by [Assist. Prof. Didem Unat](http://home.ku.edu.tr/~dunat/).
My research focused on  
designing and improving algorithms and tools for detecting concurrency  
errors in parallel programs.
