### Bio

![myPhoto](/myPhoto.jpg)

I'm Hassan Salehe Matar and I'm a Ph.D student of Computer Sciences and  
Engineering at Koc University in Istanbul. I have been lucky to be advised 
by [Assist. Prof. Didem Unat](http://home.ku.edu.tr/~dunat/) in my Ph.D. studies.  
My research focuses on designing and improving algorithms and tools for  
detecting concurrency errors in parallel programs.

I previously worked on improving performance of race detection algorithms  
using IntelÂ® TSX, and I was later interned at Intel in Munich for 1.5 years.

My projects are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/hassansalehe) but you can
read more about them [here](projects).

You can access my publications [here](publications).

My resume can be accessed [using this link](resume).
