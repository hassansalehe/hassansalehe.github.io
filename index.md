### Bio

I am Hassan Salehe Matar and a Ph.D student of Computer Sciences and
Engineering at Koc University in Istanbul. In my Ph.D. studies, I am
lucky to be advised by [Assoc. Prof. Serdar Tasiran](https://home.ku.edu.tr/~stasiran/)
and [Assist. Prof. Didem Unat](https://home.ku.edu.tr/~dunat/).  My research focuses
on designing and improving algorithms and tools for detecting concurrency
errors in parallel programs.

I previously worked on improving performance of race detection algorithms
using IntelÂ® TSX, and I was later interned at Intel in Munich for 1.5 years.

My projects are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/hassansalehe) but
you can read more about them [here](projects).

You can access my publications [here](publications).

My resume can be accessed [using this link](cv).
